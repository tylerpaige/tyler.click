# Infinite Navigation
## Infinite Regression
### Infinite Recursion

_To be played with while reading orating a text_

## Problems:
- Adding new nav bars is mapped to a list item, and new nav bars are nested in the list item. So if you reenter any part of the initial list item, the nesting of nav bars changes.
    - Either map the creation of new nav bars to a specific element within a list item (<a>?) or
    - Do not nest nav bars 
        - If this route is explored, there needs to be a smarter way to clear a series of nav bars that have already been opened
- Explore this idea with flyout menus
- Program in multiple styles of nav bars
